              body: "I came in with no dance experience but quickly found a very supportive community among the incredible people I’ve met through Foundations, and I also developed a very unexpected passion for dance. During last school year's winter quarter, I joined Dance LSHIP as a captain in the hopes of inspiring others to become better dancers, leaders, and people while also giving them the opportunity to find a home for themselves just like I did. While there were certainly moments of challenge and struggle, the overall experience I had on LSHIP was truly amazing and I don’t regret a single moment of it. If you’re interested in joining LSHIP specifically as a captain, just know that any moments of difficulty or uncertainty are nothing compared to the incredible journey that you go through with your team, along with the fact that you played a big part in shaping that journey for your team."

              body: "To think the first time I did this, I was unwillingly dragged with 10 friends (who all dropped lmao), but now I'm the one dragging people here. However, I still would never have thought to become a captain because I never thought I was good enough dance-wise for the position. I was blessed that I was able to become a captain even with my fears still lingering in my head. But being a captain was truly something I do not regret. Everyone brought a certain dynamic to the team and it made being a captain easier because everyone was friendly. The experience is so rewarding as you can see the progression of everyone throughout the quarter and know that you helped instill their passion for dance. If you are having second thoughts about being a captain, I would say do it. Don't have regrets later in your head because this experience was something of a lifetime. Foundations has given me everlasting friends and the opportunity to find my love for dance and to go even further, eventually joining VSU Modern. If you ever need to talk about dance or becoming a captain, hit me up I'll always be there to talk~ Shoutout to all my REV bbs, Dual Core, and .PDF dancers xoxo."

There are so many people from different walks of life and each one is worlds away different from you, but at the end of each quarter, you've spent countless hours working and dancing side by side with these people, and you build so much from it that those differences don't really matter anymore. Experiencing this first hand as a member, it pushed me to be a part of that process by applying for captain for the Spring quarter! Captaining was certainly an amazing experience and so rewarding because you walk through the whole process by your teammates' sides (even through it can mean dancing in a parking lot for 6 hours). But I wouldn't really have it any other way, because I'm on that stage dancing with some of my best friends who, 9 weeks before, were just complete strangers in my life! I'm really excited to be coming back to this org next year as one of the next Events Chairs! I really wanted to help bring this experience to new and returning members and I can't wait to see what the new year has in store! Cy@ all the events keke c;  P.S. HI ETA ILY K BYE"

Foundations gave me a family away from home, one that has truly changed my life (as some of my non-Foundations friends have said), and one that I wish I was a part of earlier. As a way to give back to the organization that has provided me with so much, I applied for Lship as Events Chair, given how much potential I saw in the quarterly events hosted for general members. Being Events Chair allowed me to plan social events for general members and for Lship, and along with it came a sense of satisfaction upon seeing people bond and become closer. It also allowed me to improve as a person in so many aspects – including being a leader and working with others. If you are interested in joining Foundations or applying for Lship, I would definitely recommend doing both as they have redefined my college experience in their own respective ways."

However, FC provided the opportunity and platform for people who have a common interest to learn to overcome fears and difficulties together, which is why I love this organization so much. After my first team, by the grace of God, I was blessed with being a captain with some really great people. Leading my own team was an entirely different experience than what being a general member, but nonetheless, it was even more fulfilling. Dancing inspires me to be creative, be comfortable with myself, and to overcome fears with a community. All I wanted was to be able to share that same sense of togetherness with a whole team of people, and helping them realize why we love doing what we do. I love this organization, and I really hope that in the future we can spread the opportunities that Foundations to provides to as many people as we can and provide a bigger spotlight on the dance community so that those who want to learn how to dance, can."

Life was pretty much the same every single day. The thought of dropping out of UCLA and going back home crossed my mind countless times. Meanwhile, my high school friends joined Foundations our first quarter, and it seemed like they were enjoying themselves, so I decided to try out that Spring. Foundations welcomed me with a family that I will never forget. They pushed me out of my comfort zone and never judged me for who I am. Because of Foundations and my first team, EON, I felt like I belonged. They were the ones that gave me a reason to stay. I wanted to give others the same enjoyable experience, so I became a captain for 3 teams. It is very rewarding to see people with different backgrounds all working towards the same goal and to see these people become one family. Although I am currently taking a break from dancing, I still want to be involved with the amazing organization, so I applied to be the LSHIP Relations Chair. "

So many of my personal moments now have been influenced by UCLA's dance community: the fact that I spend hours in dirty parking lots, why I don't sleep until 4 or 5 am, why all my designs just look like dance promo material, why I dress the way I dress, why I seek the [dance] idols I do now, why all my recommended YouTube videos are just dance. It seems cheesy to say that one organization has helped propelled me into avenues that I never expected before -- but it is the truth. I hope that everyone who has joined Foundations has taken away something -- no matter how small or even if it isn't dance related -- and has seen how that made changes in their lives."
