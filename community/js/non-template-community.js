              body: "I came in with no dance experience but quickly found a very supportive community among the incredible people I’ve met through Foundations, and I also developed a very unexpected passion for dance. During last school year's winter quarter, I joined Dance LSHIP as a captain in the hopes of inspiring others to become better dancers, leaders, and people while also giving them the opportunity to find a home for themselves just like I did. While there were certainly moments of challenge and struggle, the overall experience I had on LSHIP was truly amazing and I don’t regret a single moment of it. If you’re interested in joining LSHIP specifically as a captain, just know that any moments of difficulty or uncertainty are nothing compared to the incredible journey that you go through with your team, along with the fact that you played a big part in shaping that journey for your team."

              body: "To think the first time I did this, I was unwillingly dragged with 10 friends (who all dropped lmao), but now I'm the one dragging people here. However, I still would never have thought to become a captain because I never thought I was good enough dance-wise for the position. I was blessed that I was able to become a captain even with my fears still lingering in my head. But being a captain was truly something I do not regret. Everyone brought a certain dynamic to the team and it made being a captain easier because everyone was friendly. The experience is so rewarding as you can see the progression of everyone throughout the quarter and know that you helped instill their passion for dance. If you are having second thoughts about being a captain, I would say do it. Don't have regrets later in your head because this experience was something of a lifetime. Foundations has given me everlasting friends and the opportunity to find my love for dance and to go even further, eventually joining VSU Modern. If you ever need to talk about dance or becoming a captain, hit me up I'll always be there to talk~ Shoutout to all my REV bbs, Dual Core, and .PDF dancers xoxo."

There are so many people from different walks of life and each one is worlds away different from you, but at the end of each quarter, you've spent countless hours working and dancing side by side with these people, and you build so much from it that those differences don't really matter anymore. Experiencing this first hand as a member, it pushed me to be a part of that process by applying for captain for the Spring quarter! Captaining was certainly an amazing experience and so rewarding because you walk through the whole process by your teammates' sides (even through it can mean dancing in a parking lot for 6 hours). But I wouldn't really have it any other way, because I'm on that stage dancing with some of my best friends who, 9 weeks before, were just complete strangers in my life! I'm really excited to be coming back to this org next year as one of the next Events Chairs! I really wanted to help bring this experience to new and returning members and I can't wait to see what the new year has in store! Cy@ all the events keke c;  P.S. HI ETA ILY K BYE"

Foundations gave me a family away from home, one that has truly changed my life (as some of my non-Foundations friends have said), and one that I wish I was a part of earlier. As a way to give back to the organization that has provided me with so much, I applied for Lship as Events Chair, given how much potential I saw in the quarterly events hosted for general members. Being Events Chair allowed me to plan social events for general members and for Lship, and along with it came a sense of satisfaction upon seeing people bond and become closer. It also allowed me to improve as a person in so many aspects – including being a leader and working with others. If you are interested in joining Foundations or applying for Lship, I would definitely recommend doing both as they have redefined my college experience in their own respective ways."

However, FC provided the opportunity and platform for people who have a common interest to learn to overcome fears and difficulties together, which is why I love this organization so much. After my first team, by the grace of God, I was blessed with being a captain with some really great people. Leading my own team was an entirely different experience than what being a general member, but nonetheless, it was even more fulfilling. Dancing inspires me to be creative, be comfortable with myself, and to overcome fears with a community. All I wanted was to be able to share that same sense of togetherness with a whole team of people, and helping them realize why we love doing what we do. I love this organization, and I really hope that in the future we can spread the opportunities that Foundations to provides to as many people as we can and provide a bigger spotlight on the dance community so that those who want to learn how to dance, can."

              body: "Coming into UCLA, I was far away from home and was homesick. During my first two quarters in college, I rarely stepped out of my dorm besides getting food. Life was pretty much the same every single day. The thought of dropping out of UCLA and going back home crossed my mind countless times. Meanwhile, my high school friends joined Foundations our first quarter, and it seemed like they were enjoying themselves, so I decided to try out that Spring. Foundations welcomed me with a family that I will never forget. They pushed me out of my comfort zone and never judged me for who I am. Because of Foundations and my first team, EON, I felt like I belonged. They were the ones that gave me a reason to stay. I wanted to give others the same enjoyable experience, so I became a captain for 3 teams. It is very rewarding to see people with different backgrounds all working towards the same goal and to see these people become one family. Although I am currently taking a break from dancing, I still want to be involved with the amazing organization, so I applied to be the LSHIP Relations Chair. "

So many of my personal moments now have been influenced by UCLA's dance community: the fact that I spend hours in dirty parking lots, why I don't sleep until 4 or 5 am, why all my designs just look like dance promo material, why I dress the way I dress, why I seek the [dance] idols I do now, why all my recommended YouTube videos are just dance. It seems cheesy to say that one organization has helped propelled me into avenues that I never expected before -- but it is the truth. I hope that everyone who has joined Foundations has taken away something -- no matter how small or even if it isn't dance related -- and has seen how that made changes in their lives."

I remember binging hours and hours of 1 million dance studio on youtube and just thinking to myself: if I could have one wish granted, I’d want to be able to dance. But I never thought that it was possible for me. Foundations changed that. It gave me a chance to do something that I’ve always wanted to try. I never expected that I could feel...comfortable, dancing alongside others. But I was blown away by the overwhelming support around me, and soon enough Foundations felt like a home to me. Foundations was more than just a dance team. On my two teams, I’ve met so many precious friends, shared so much laughter and created so many irreplaceable memories. The months I spent dancing with Foundations have definitely been the brightest and happiest moments of my life. Nothing but love for this organization. "

              body: "I wouldn’t be the dancer I am today without that first step that Foundations allowed me to take and I am so grateful for that, which is why I’m back as one of the Showcase Chairs for a second time. After having performed so many times and having even competed in the community a few times, I’ve almost forgotten how scary and emotional that first performance with Foundations really was. But being a part of the Showcase committee has allowed me to revisit that and see the powerful effect that the Foundations experience can have on people, from the moment where everyone is huddled backstage hearing pep talks from their directors, to the moment where they come off stage high from the adrenaline of the culmination of their hard work. I think it’s so beautiful to see fledgling dancers have their first taste of the stage, or their first time performing for such a large crowd, or their first (and last?) time sharing the stage with the people they’ve shared the parking lots with for almost a quarter. Some of them may never dance again, but some of them will go on to become the next generation of amazing dancers in the community, and none of them will leave the same people they were before. That’s the beauty of FC! #buildyourself"

Over time, though, I began to see Foundations as something far greater than just a dance org on campus. I saw how passionate people were about building the community, both dancers and leadership alike. Strangely enough, I learned more about myself and how to be out of my comfort zone than I did learn about dance, but that in turn taught me how to grow as a dancer. And finally, I met some of the nicest and coolest people being apart of this org, some of which I’m lucky enough to call friends. So yeah, if you’re on the fence about whether you should join Foundations for the first time, JUST DO IT. You may end up loving it."

I have never been more confident or happier than I have while being a part of the Foundations family. I joined LSHIP my 2nd year as a Captain, and joined Admin LSHIP my 3rd year. Now, I am the current Executive for Foundations, and it has been such an amazing journey as I grew alongside the organization. It's rare to find an organization where you so wholeheartedly believe in its message and mission, but I feel very blessed to have discovered that in Foundations. Take it from someone who was ready to quit after her first practice-- learning how to dance is so, so achievable as long as you keep your heart open to the endless possibilities for growth that Foundations can lend you. I've seen it in the shyest, most in-their-shell non-believers, and most importantly, I've seen the change in myself. Never pass up an opportunity to build yourself."

I was overwhelmed by the amount of friendly people that I met at auditions, people who clearly loved the organization and were eager to help clueless, fumbling beginners like me. I applied and auditioned not expecting much, but from it, I got everything. Throughout the first two quarters I spent with Foundations, I met some of the most wonderful people in the world. The strangers who you first consider mere teammates quickly become family. This organization is run by and filled with so many talented, dedicated, down to earth individuals, people who I cannot imagine having made it through my first year without. I applied for LSHIP because I wanted to give back, to be able to connect others to it firsthand so that they could maybe have the same lovely experience that I did. I adore FC for its tireless efforts in creating an environment that is truly welcome to everyone, for the unwaveringly positive energy that is fostered at every event they hold, for the amazing people behind the scenes that make it happen. I think that everyone should try it out at least once - I promise you won’t regret it."

I really enjoyed the experience and decided that I wanted to recreate that experience for people who felt like me, people who felt self-conscious about themselves, people who were afraid to try something new. Even though I've been dancing for less than a year, I was fortunate enough to become a captain, and it's one of the most rewarding experiences that I've had. Being able to see people really grow and fall in love with the art is endearing. So join Foundations, push yourself outside of your comfort zone.

Thanks to this organization, I was able to put those dreams into action, and begin an incredible and unforgettable journey through college, building confidence, meeting new people, and stepping myself further into the dance community. And, not only was I inspired to pursue dance, but also found a home and support system as I was making a rather difficult transition into UCLA. I wouldn’t be who I am now, or be having such a meaningful college experience if Foundations wasn’t there for this lost, shy freshman a year ago. Foundations will forever hold a special place in my heart, and I’m truly honored to be a part of this organization. I‘m excited for the adventures that lie ahead as a part of LSHIP <3 <br/> So why do I love to dance? Many, many reasons… but to keep it short and sweet, dance genuinely encompasses everything I love and stand for. Community, artistry/self-expression, being present/aware, physical and emotional well-being, self-improvement, growth, having fun, etc. etc. etc... you get the jist. And the beautiful part is, ANYONE CAN DANCE— all you have to do is start. So, to all the new and aspiring dancers: keep pushing!

I was a captain for one of the 2018 spring quarter teams, and the experience led me to a lot of self-reflection. Leaving my comfort zone was not something I had always been open to, but the warmth of the Foundations community motivated me. Every quarter, Foundations welcomes a new wave of beginning dancers who push themselves, despite any fear or hesitation, to try something new. Surrounded and inspired by that energy, I started to challenge myself as well, and as a captain I have my team to thank for accepting me as a leader, while also helping me along that path. Watching my team grow alongside me throughout the quarter was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, and I will treasure those memories forever."
